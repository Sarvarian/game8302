(Jump)

Jump system that jump happen when player releases the
jump button. So the more holding the jump, the higher
the jump.  
But the maximum pre jump holding can't get very long,
so player learn it intuitively and not over using it.  

Like say is player push down the jump, player character
slows down and prepare for jump and when player releases
the button, jump starts.  
But player movement velocity also adds to the jump initial
velocity, so player should balance between movement velocity
and jump preparation.  

After jump starts player has no control over its airborne
movement.
But maybe adds ability for player to have some control
on fall speed. Like slow down to aim and shoot or
fall fast and punch down.

(Modularization)

Modularize in such a way that things
that changes together, stays together.
